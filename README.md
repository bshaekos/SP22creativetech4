# Creative Tech 4 - Spring 2022

Project 1: 

Rube Goldberg Machine 

Teammate: 

Yining Gao

Project Brief: 

The Web was built around the concept of requests and responses - a constant back and forth between a server on the Internet and a browser on your computer. As it grew and expanded the need arose to get exchange going not just between a person and a machine but among many machines.

A user initiates a single action - a click of a button, a text entry, a page scroll - and the browser triggers a chain of events, most of them hidden behind the veil of the Cloud, to pass around some data from one server to another, like a ball in a pinball machine. The data can be used to request other data, to trigger different responses from servers, to capture more data. It can be formatted, rearranged, displayed in different contexts, - juxtaposed with other data.

In the spirit of Rube Goldberg's fascination with the mechanism over the end result - how can we build similar systems in the digital realm? What kind of data could be passed around? With services could be chained together to produce some unexpected outcomes? What would the triggers look like - and the end results? None of those need to be practical, efficient or even reasonable - the focus is on the celebration of the chains of events and the mechanisms that enable them.
